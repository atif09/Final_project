# Final Capstone Project – Little Lemon Restaurant

This project is the final capstone for the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera. It’s a React-based frontend web application built for a fictional restaurant called Little Lemon. The main goal was to bring together all the skills learned throughout the program into a real-world project.

## About the Project

The application includes multiple pages, a booking system, reusable components, and routing. It’s fully responsive and follows modern frontend development practices. Every component has been built manually using React and styled with CSS.

## Features

- Multiple pages using React Router
- A working booking form with basic validation
- A confirmation page after form submission
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Reusable components like Navbar, Footer, Cards, etc.
- Simple routing and navigation structure

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (Flexbox and Grid)
- Visual Studio Code

2. Install the dependencies:


3. Start the development server:


This will open the project in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## What I Learned

Working on this project helped reinforce everything from component-based design to routing, form management, and overall project structure in React. It also gave me more experience writing clean and maintainable code in a real-world project format.

## Final Thoughts

This was a great opportunity to pull together everything I’ve worked on during the Meta Front-End Developer program. I enjoyed building this and learning more about how a full React project comes together from start to finish.
